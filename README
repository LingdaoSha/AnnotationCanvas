<h2>What Is RoCanvas</h2>

A small and easy to embed HTML5 open-source drawing board component. Add it to your site and let your visitors draw anything they want. With some server-side programming you can save their drawings to the server, create galleries, contests, let them draw their avatars, or create a cool lovely site like http://drawapig.desktopcreatures.com/.
