## What is Annotation Canvas
A small and easy to embed js class for enabling users to annotate images.. 
It is a fork of the excellent RoCanvas.js - see  http://re.trotoys.com/article/rocanvas/ for more information RoCanvas.js

## Online demo
...is yet to come... 


## What makes this Different from RoCanvas.js
- More drawing tools (arrow, textbox, ellipse)
- Added possibility of loading a background image
- Added optional scaling (eg. for loading a large / hi-res image, then scale it down with CSS, but still have the annotations saved in the high resolution)
- Added truly "hollow" shapes (ie. shapes without white fill)
- Implemented undo/redo functionality
- Added visual indicators of selected tool/width/color
- Added some extra settings (e.g. hard offset X/Y, scaleFactor etc)
- Added border around #FFF color
- Fixed some bugs (most notably related to redrawing)
